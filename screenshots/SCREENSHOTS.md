 # Screenshots
 Screenshots of BaldPhone will be uploaded to this folder
 
 Each language will has it's own folder
 
 Here is how screenshots are named:
  - BP-
  - ARROWS- (if accessibility mode is set to Hard or Medium t(true) or f(false))
  - THEME- (right now only d(dark) or l(light))
  - RATIO- (16:9 will be named as 16_9, if screenshot is landscape than 9_16)
  - UNIQUE_ID- (BaldPhone looks different on different phones, with different font and zoom settings, each phone will have different ID)
  - NAME_OF_STATE- (States are listed in file [STATES](https://github.com/UriahShaulMandel/BaldPhone/blob/master/screenshots/STATES))
  - VERSION_CODE (The version <B><U>CODE</U></B>, not name, integer that can be found under Technical Information)
  
  All together:
  - BP-t-l-9_16-UPSP-SingleContactActivity_KeyboardUp-63
  - BP-t-d-16_9-UPSP-ContactsActivity_Starred-64
